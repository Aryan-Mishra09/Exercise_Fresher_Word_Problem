Compound words are words formed by combining two or more smaller words. For example, "teaspoon" can be formed by combining "tea" and "spoon." The Compound Word Finder program is used to find such compound words within a list of input words.

How It Works
The program reads a list of words from a specified input file and stores them in a data structure.
It then identifies prefixes for each word and adds them to a queue along with the remaining part of the word.
Using a breadth-first search algorithm, the program explores the possible compound words by removing prefixes and checking if the remaining part is also a valid word from the input list.
The program keeps track of the longest and second-longest compound words it discovers.
